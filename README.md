# Explorer
Simple Blockchain Explorer written in JS.
This code uses the Express library to create a simple web server that listens for HTTP requests. The server has two routes: /block/:blockHeight and /transaction/:transactionId. The first route is used to retrieve information about a specific block in the blockchain, given its height. The second route is used to retrieve information about a specific transaction in the blockchain, given its ID.
